# Be Safe Pakistan

A crowdsourcing platform to provide latest 2022 floods updates, database of local and international welfare organizations, local fundraisers and volunteers for ongoing flood relief efforts across Pakistan.

## Getting started

This is static website, built with `next.js` and styled with `tailwindcss 3.0`. To get started with this template, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.
## Roadmap

This is initial version of [BeSafePakistan](https://besafepakistan.com) however we need to add or change following items:

- [ ] Show interactive, static imagery and video flood-battered areas with captions
- [ ] Show flood devastation stats in form interactive graphs, charts etc (data gathering in process)
- [ ] Show all news links with on-scroll animation
- [ ] Improve rendering `fundraisers` data (formatting and cleaning up the data - WIP)
- [ ] Add functionality to export fundraisers data as CSV
- [ ] Add functionality to copy welfare organization bank account details (only for local), See *`Fundraisers.jsx`* already implemented something like this
- [ ] Update news links daily
- [ ] Update flood devastation stats daily

If you're interested in working on these items, happy to talk :)
